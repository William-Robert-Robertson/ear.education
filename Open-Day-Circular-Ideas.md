# ear.education Open Day Circular Ideas

Pizza in Kachelofen - maybe too warm for June?
Cheese
Repaired Household Appliances
Re-Used Solar Panels + AGM Batteries - providing electric light to part of the house for the open day
ELM Compost
Knife Making from Scrap Steel - forging not done at Trubschachen because of bulky equipment needed and risk of noise disturbing neighbours
Glockenspiel - built with 2nd hand cow bells - possibly water powered

Sauerkraut from Leftover Vegetables
Coffee Grain re-use
Wood ash re-use
Fermented Apple Juice
Glass Art from Recycled Glass
Pralines and French Truffles - including cream from local milk and flavours from leftover fruit
Metal Castings (e.g. bells) cast using 3D printed moulds, lost wax casting in vacuum and brass or bronze scrap - may be too complicated for open day
